                                Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our
                                servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on
                                how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings
                                and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages
                                and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information
                                (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).

                                Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise
                                or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the
                                Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current
                                location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing
                                access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you
                                may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.

                        <strong><i>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless
                        otherwise required by law.</i>
                        <br><br>
                        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice,
                        unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).
                        <br><br>
                        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
                        anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
                        backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until
                        deletion is possible.

                        <h4>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h4>
                        <strong><i>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</i>
                        <br><br>
                        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the
                        security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
                        electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we
                        cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
                        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your
                        personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only
                        access the Services within a secure environment.
                        <br><br><br>

                        <strong><i>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</i>
                        <br><br>
                        We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such
                        personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of
                        such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users
                        less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
                        delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18,

                        <br><br>
                        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT') feature or
                        setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored
                        and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been
                        finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
                        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
                        future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
