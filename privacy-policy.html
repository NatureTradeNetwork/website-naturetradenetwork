                                Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our
                                servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on

                                and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages

                                Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise
                                or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the
                                Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current
                                location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing
                                access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you

                        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
                        anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
                        backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until

                        security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
                        electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we
                        cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
                        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your
                        personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only
                        access the Services within a secure environment.

                        less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
                        delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18,

                        <h4>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h4>
                        <br><br>
                        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT') feature or
                        setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored
                        and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been
                        finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
                        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
                        future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
